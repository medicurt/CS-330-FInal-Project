This README is a journal response to prompts in the CS-330 class. In this README, three major elements of a prompt will
be addressed along with its subcomponents. 

The first prompt asks how the author approaches software design; what new design skills the author has gained from
working on the project; what design process the author followed during the project work; and how tactics from
my design approach could be applied in future work. The author took a step-wise iterative approach in designing
this project, starting with the concept of what the project should look like and setting up visual studio, followed by
the implementation of drawing triangles, then adding textures, adding camera movement and controls, and finally
attacking the problem of lighting. One of the best design skills that the project helped the author to craft
was the ability to use tracer bullets, code knockouts (strategically commenting code to observe effects), and 
'find' functionality to work backwards and develop a sound understanding of how different functions in OpenGL work
from higher to lower order; in other words, the author cultivated problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. The author
used comments and an engineering journal to then keep track of the things that were learned. The design process was
iterative, implementing one feature-complete deliverable at a time. Tactics from the design approach will be applied in
future work through independent learning of API development. The author has just accepted a job developing APIs and
will need to undertake a similar process of independent study, experimentation, and problem solving to prepare for the role.

The prompt also asks how the author approaches developing programs, including what new development strategies were used, how
iteration factored into the development process, and how the author's approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones.
One development strategy that the author tried to cultivate and rely on extensively throughout this project was the use of
abstraction to make code easy to change and as decoupled as possible; one example of this is using the 'offset' variable
to ensure that each of the mala beads were spaced more or less the same distance apart. Iteration was relied upon heavily 
through the course of developing the 3D scene. After each week's assignments were attempted, the author would apply what was learned
in order to implement a new deliverable for the final project. The author's approach to developing code has evolved in the sense that
one's skills evolve with practice. Developing this final scene without an iterative approach would have seemed like a herculean task;
approaching this course without a sound understanding of abstraction and problem-solving skills is, in the author's opinion, a
recipe for failure. 

Finally, the prompt asks how computer science can help the author in achieving their goals, how computer graphics and visualization 
gives new knowledge and skills that can applied in future education, and how graphics and visualizations give knowledge and skills
that can be applied in a future profession. Computer science helps the author achieve their goals by building a skill and knowledge
base from which to draw when encountering a new engineering problem, both through an understanding of the basic principles of modern
computer architectures as well as an understanding of how to break down problems, engineer solutions, and do so in a realistic,
repeatable fashion. Computer graphics and visualization has helped the author develop a greater understanding of the visual C and C++
languages, a better understanding of how abstraction is applied in programming, as well as a better appreciation for matrices
as data structures. These skills will aid the author in having a better understanding for how computer graphics work, and in developing
programs that use abstraction and matrix data structures in their design. There should be a significant degree of overlap between which
of these skills are applicable to education, and which are applicable to work.
